# User Documentation

The following paragraphs will outline the usage of Open Audio Search (*OAS*). This is directed towards users of the system and should help you getting started easily. We intend to expand and improve this document over time. If something in here is unclear to you or you miss explanations, please feel invited to [open an issue](https://github.com/openaudiosearch/openaudiosearch/issues/new/choose).


## User Interface

The main page of *OAS* shows the `Discover`-Tab. It displays a subset of audio tracks, which are indexed into the system and you're might be curious about. On the cards, you find some basic informations on the track, like *Title*, *Duration* and a short *Description*. In case you want to get more information, just click the card to get into details view. Or if you want to hear the audio track right away, just press the play button on the upper-right side of the card.


### Search

As *OAS* is a search engine for audio, one of its core features is to find specific words or terms in audio tracks. To accomplish such a search, you can either use the searchbox in the header of the frontpage. Or navigate in the `Search`-Tab and enter your query there in the searchbox. Results are getting displayed right in the middle of the page and you can sort them according to Publishing Date or Duration. They are shown as cards, from which you get basic informations on the audio track: *Title*, *Description* of the track, its *Duration*, as well as those parts in the transcript, in which the search term can be found. You can jump right into that part of the audio just by hitting the box around this part of the transcript. Of course you can play the whole audio file as well by pushing the Play-Button on the upper-right part of the results cards.

To fine-tune your search, you can use the facettes on the left side of the page, with which you can filter the results according to *Creator*, *Genre*, *Publishing Date* and/or *Duration*. You can find examples on how to apply such facettes in the `How To...`-Section below.

To access the whole information on the resulted audio track, just click on results cards to get into its details view. Here you can access the transcript and jump into specific parts in the audio track just by clicking a word.


### Login
